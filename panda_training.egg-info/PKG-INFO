        This repository contains the workspace for the `panda_openai_sim` ROS package. It
        includes all the components (submodules and code) to create a create a
        Openai gym environment for the Panda Emika Franka robot. This workspace consists of two
        main components the `panda_openai_sim` package and the `panda_training` package. The
        the first package (`panda_openai_sim`) contains a simulated version of the Panda robot
        together with a Panda gym environment that can be used to train RL algorithms as is done
        with the original [openai_gym robotics environments](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#robotics).
        The second package (`panda_training`) contains several examples of RL training scripts
        that can be used together with the simulation and Openai gym environments of the
        `panda_openai_sim` package.
        
        ## Environments
        
        The `panda_openai_sim` package currently contains the following task environments:
        
        - **PandaPickAndPlace-v0:** Lift a block into the air.
        - **PandaPush-v0:** Push a block to a goal position.
        - **PandaReach-v0:** Move fetch to a goal position.
        - **PandaSlide-v0:** Slide a puck to a goal position.
        
        These environments were based on the original [openai_gym robotics environments](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#robotics).
        
        ## Installation and Usage
        
        Please see the [docs](https://rickstaa.github.io/panda_openai_sim/) for installation
        and usage instructions.
